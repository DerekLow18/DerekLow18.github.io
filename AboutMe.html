  <h3> So who am I really?</h3>
  <p>
  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in the lovely Greenpoint area, and lived there until I was 18, at which point
  my parents moved to Oakland Gardens, Queens. I boarded at Milton Academy, and conseqently had four years of experience living away
  from home before I came to college.

  <h3> Why do I enjoy coding/computer programming/ computer science?</h3>
  <p>
  There are several reasons I enjoy computer science. Among all my different 
  courses that I've taken throughout my life,I've had the most 
  satisfaction with in computer programming sources. To me, 
  not many assignments can beat programming assignments
  in terms of the sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. 
  I've always enjoyed tinkering with electronics, and fiddling 
  with my laptops at both hardwards and software level. 
  Additionally, I believe that computer science will continue 
  be a huge component in all aspects of life and continue to grow.
