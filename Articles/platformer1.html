  <h2>Platformer: The QuadTree</h2>
  <p>
  Hello, everyone! This post marks the first post about a personal
  pet project of mine, a platformer game in Python! The project
  first started as a project in college, where I repurposed a 
  frogger game thta we developed in my object oriented programming
  class, and turned it into a platformer. While the platformer worked,
  the game ran awfully slowly. The reason for poor run time was
  evident; while the characters would move and successfully check 
  for collisions with the surrounding objects, the collision
  detection algorithm was awful!
  <br>
  The original collision detection algorithm essentially placed
  all objects in the game into a list. This list includes players,
  monsters, and platforms. Then, the collision detection algorithm
  checks for collisions between everything in the list. For
  those of you that have taken an Algorithms class or have heard of
  runtime analysis, checking <i>N</i> number of items against <i>N</i>
   items is O(n^2) runtime, and the collision detection algorithm itself
  checks for overlaps in pixels. As you can see, it's a slow process,
  and only gets slower with the number of objects in the game. So
  whats the alternative?
  <br>
  Here we introduce the quadTree. The data structure is essentially
  a tree, where we start with the root and branch out to four nodes
  at every branch. After a certain criteria is met, the branches each
  may further branch again into an additional four branches.
