  <h2>Platformer: The QuadTree</h2>
  <p>
  Hello, everyone! This post marks the first post about a personal
  pet project of mine, a platformer game in Python! The project
  first started as a project in college, where I repurposed a 
  frogger game thta we developed in my object oriented programming
  class, and turned it into a platformer. While the platformer worked,
  the game ran awfully slowly. The reason for poor run time was
  evident; while the characters would move and successfully check 
  for collisions with the surrounding objects, the collision
  detection algorithm was awful!
  <br>
  The original collision detection algorithm essentially placed
  all objects in the game into a list. This list includes players,
  monsters, and platforms. Then, the collision detection algorithm
  checks for collisions between everything in the list. As you can
  see, checking <i>N</i> number of items against <i>N</i> items is
  O(n^2) runtime, and the collision detection algorithm itself
  checks for overlaps in pixels. As you can see, it's a slow process,
  and only gets slower with the number of objects in the game.
