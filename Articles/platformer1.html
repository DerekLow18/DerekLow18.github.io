  <h2>Platformer: The Beginning</h2>
  <p>
  Hello, everyone! This post marks the first post about a personal
  pet project of mine, a platformer game in Python! The project
  first started as a project in college, where I repurposed a 
  frogger game thta we developed in my object oriented programming
  class, and turned it into a platformer. While the platformer worked,
  the game ran awfully slowly. The reason for poor run time was
  evident; while the characters would move and successfully check 
  for collisions with the surrounding objects, the collision
  detection algorithm was awful!
