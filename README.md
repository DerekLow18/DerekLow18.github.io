# Website Hosting on Github

Hello! This is the github page of my personal website, dereklow18.github.io. I am using this website as a tool to learn HTML, CSS, JS, and other frontend development tools. Hopefully, in the future, I will use this website as an exploration into backend using Python as well.

I will also be using this website as a place to keep track of personal project progress! And probably write about things I want to write about. In essence, this is a website dedicate to me and it'll be whatever I want it to be!

# Bard College Language and Thinking
This website started during my first year as an instructor for the L&T coding workshops at Bard College, where I received my B.A. in Computer Science and Biology. According to the Bard College Language and Thinking Website:
'''
The Bard College Language & Thinking Program, founded in 1981, is an intensive introduction to the liberal arts and sciences with a particular focus on writing. It is attended by all incoming Bard students during the last three weeks of August. Students read extensively, work on a variety of projects in writing and other formats, and meet throughout the day in small groups and in one-on-one conferences with faculty. The work aims to cultivate habits of thoughtful reading, clear articulation, accurate self-critique, and productive collaboration.
