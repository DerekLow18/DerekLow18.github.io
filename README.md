# Website Hosting on Github

Hello! This is the github page of my personal website, dereklow18.github.io. I am using this website as a tool to learn HTML, CSS, JS, and other frontend development tools. Hopefully, in the future, I will use this website as an exploration into backend using Python as well.

I will also be using this website as a place to keep track of personal project progress! And probably write about things I want to write about. In essence, this is a website dedicate to me and it'll be whatever I want it to be!
