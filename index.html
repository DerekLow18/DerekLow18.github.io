  <h3>So what exactly is this website?</h3>

  <p>I'm not sure how you got here, but you've arrived at my personal website!
  I'm a recent graduate of Bard College, joint majoring in Computer Science 
  and Biology. If you'd like to know more about my senior project,
  there is a link for it in the menu, under "Projects". Basically,
  I created this website as an education hobby in my free time. I'm using this
  website as a tool for learning the basics of web development, as well as 
  building a professional profile/portfolio, as well as talk about things that
  I want to talk about! It's my very own slice of the (internet) cake. So feel
  free to look around while you're here!</p>
